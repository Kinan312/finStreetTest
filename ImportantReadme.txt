First of all, there are some notes in Figma Design.

I followed CDD Component Driven Development methodology  in UI developing.

1-divide the entire UI into a small reusable components
2-used Redux-toolkit for state management which is better performance than regular redux
3-I used Bottom Tabs instead of Drawers due to the recent updates to the user experience being proven to be better as a UX.
--(Please note if there are more pages, the latest tab can be used as a button to open the Drawers)--

4- I have used Typescript because it is the best performance of Javascript and can benefit from object-oriented programming features such as (interfaces, polymorphism, abstraction, etc).

5- I have used Path Alias in imports
